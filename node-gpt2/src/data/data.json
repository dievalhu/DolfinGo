        "abstract": "BACKGROUND:In multiple myeloma (MM), impact of specific chromosomal translocations involving IgH (14q21 locus, including t(4;14), t(11;14), and t(14;16)) has been explored extensively. However, over 15% MM patients harboring IgH translocation with undefined partners have long been ignored. METHODS:A prospective non-randomized cohort study with a total of 715 newly-diagnosed MM cases was conducted, 13.6% of whom were t(14;undefined) positive. The whole cohort was divided into four groups: no IgH split (47.7%); t(14;undefined) (13.6%); t(11;14) (17.6%); and t(4;14) or t(14;16) group (21.1%). RESULTS:Median OS for the four groups was 84.2, not reached (NR), 58.7, and 44.2\u00a0months, respectively, with P values for t(14;undefined) vs no IgH split, t(11;14), and t(4;14)/t(14;16) groups of 0.197, 0.022, and 0.001, respectively. In bortezomib-based group, the survival advantage gained by t(14;undefined) group was much more significant compared to t(11;14) and t(4;14)/t(14;16) groups. Importantly, t(14;undefined) turned out to be an independent predictive factor for longer OS of MM patients in multivariate analysis, especially in the context of bortezomib treatment. Similar results were also observed in the PUMCH external validation cohort. CONCLUSION:Collectively, our data confirmed and externally validated the favorable prognosis of the t(14;undefined) groups, especially in the era of novel agents."

Specifically, we found pathogenic variants in the POLR3A (n\u00a0=\u00a02), POLR1C (n\u00a0=\u00a01), RARS1 (n\u00a0=\u00a01), and TUBB4A (n\u00a0=\u00a01) genes, which are typically associated with severe early-onset HLDs, and in the GJA1 gene (n\u00a0=\u00a01), which is associated with oculodentodigital dysplasia. Duplication of a large chromosome X region encompassing PLP1 and a pathogenic GJC2 variant were found in two patients, both females, with early-onset HLDs persisting into adulthood. Finally, we found likely pathogenic variants in PEX3 (n\u00a0=\u00a01) and PEX13 (n\u00a0=\u00a01) and potentially relevant variants of unknown significance in TBCD (n\u00a0=\u00a01), which are genes associated with severe, early-onset diseases with central hypomyelination/dysmyelination.<br><br><b>Conclusions: </b>A hypomyelinating pattern characterizes a relevant number of undefined leukoencephalopathies in adulthood.

Yet radiology residents and fellows will likely one day experience the benefits of an AI-enabled clinical training. This will offer them a customized learning experience and the ability to analyze large quantities of data about their progress in residency, with substantially less manual effort than is currently required. Additionally, they will need to learn how to interact with AI tools in clinical practice and, more importantly, understand how to evaluate AI outputs in a critical fashion as yet another piece of information contributing to the interpretation of an imaging examination. Although the exact role AI will play in the future practice of radiology remains undefined, it will surely be integrated into the education of future radiologists."

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND:Survival prediction in patients presenting with malignancy of undefined primary origin (MUO) is challenging, with a lack of validated prognostic tools. Biomarkers of the systemic inflammatory response independently predict survival in other cancer types, but their role in MUO is unclear. The aim of this study was to assess biomarkers of the systemic inflammatory response in patients presenting with MUO. PATIENTS AND METHODS:A biobank of 1049 patients presenting with MUO referred to a regional oncology service in Scotland was analysed. Key inflammatory biomarkers (white cell count, neutrophil count and C-reactive protein combined with albumin [to give the modified Glasgow Prognostic Score {mGPS}]) were examined. The relationship between these and survival was examined using Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression methods. RESULTS:Data were available for 1049 patients. Median survival was 4.3 months (interquartile range: 1.7-16.0 months). On multivariate analysis mGPS was independently associated with survival and stratified survival from 13.6 months (mGPS: 0) to 2.3 months (mGPS: 2) (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). The mGPS was predictive of survival on multivariate analysis in patients found to have a non-cancer diagnosis (p\u00a0=\u00a00.034), an identified primary cancer (0.002), cancer of unknown primary (CUP) (p\u00a0=\u00a00.011), those for whom biopsy was not done (MUO) (p\u00a0=\u00a00.036), those found to have an identified primary cancer (0.002) and even those found to have a non-cancer diagnosis (p\u00a0=\u00a00.034) after further detailed investigations. In patients with CUP mGPS predicted survival regardless of the recognised clinicopathological prognostic subgroup (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). CONCLUSIONS:The results of the present study demonstrate that biomarkers of the systemic inflammatory response are reliable prognostic factors in patients presenting with MUO. These simple, objective, routine clinical tests may inform clinical management."

Therefore, hiPSCs offer unprecedented opportunities for patient-specific cell therapies, modeling of human diseases, biomarker discovery, and drug testing. However, clinical applications of hiPSCs require xeno-free and, ideally, chemically defined methods for their generation, expansion, and cryopreservation. In this chapter, we present a chemically defined and xeno-free slow freezing method for hiPSCs along with a chemically undefined protocol. Both approaches yield reasonable post-thaw viability and cell growth."

Whether PCT can detect secondary bacterial infections or reflect target tissue injury in this setting is still unclear. Here we performed a meta-analysis to review the prognostic value of PCT for severe disease and adverse outcome events in COVID-19.Methods: We searched relevant publications in online databases. Studies were included if they reported categorical data according to disease severity and/or outcomes. We analysed extracted data using fixed or random-effects meta-analysis models, as appropriate, depending on the presence of significant heterogeneity. Results: Data from 14 studies (3492 patients) were included in the analysis. Overall, 163 of 256 patients with elevated PCT had severe disease (63.7%) compared with 553 of 2047 with negative PCT (27.0%) (OR: 5.92; 95% CI: 3.20 to 10.94). Elevated PCT was also associated with adverse outcomes (OR: 13.1; 95% CI: 7.37 to 23.1). PCT was increased in 22.8% and 30.6% of patients with the severe course and adverse outcome, respectively. Rates of secondary bacterial infections ranged from 4.7% to 19.5% and were associated with increased risk of severe course or fatal outcomes (OR: 20.8; 95% CI: 11.6 to 37.4). Conclusions: Elevated PCT levels could identify a subset of COVID-19 patients at increased risk of severe disease and adverse outcome. Its limitations include low sensitivity and undefined cost-utility ratio. Whether PCT may be used for detecting secondary bacterial infections and guiding antibiotic therapy in COVID-19 is still undefined."

        "abstract": "Gonadal steroids modulate growth hormone (GH) secretion and the pubertal growth spurt via undefined central pathways. GH-releasing hormone (GHRH) neurons express estrogen receptor \u03b1 (ER\u03b1) and androgen receptor (AR), suggesting changing levels of gonadal steroids during puberty directly modulate the somatotropic axis. We generated mice with deletion of ER\u03b1 in GHRH cells (GHRH<sup>\u0394ER\u03b1</sup>), which displayed reduced body length in both sexes. Timing of puberty onset was similar in both groups, but puberty completion was delayed in GHRH<sup>\u0394ER\u03b1</sup> females. Lack of AR in GHRH cells (GHRH<sup>\u0394AR</sup> mice) induced no changes in body length, but puberty completion was also delayed in females. Using a mouse model with two reporter genes, we observed that, while GHRH<sup>tdTom</sup> neurons minimally colocalize with Kiss1<sup>hrGFP</sup> in prepubertal mice, \u223c30% of GHRH neurons coexpressed both reporter genes in adult females, but not in males. Developmental analysis of <i>Ghrh</i> and <i>Kiss1</i> expression suggested that a subpopulation of ER\u03b1 neurons in the arcuate nucleus of female mice undergoes a shift in phenotype, from GHRH to Kiss1, during pubertal transition. Our findings demonstrate that direct actions of gonadal steroids in GHRH neurons modulate growth and puberty and indicate that GHRH/Kiss1 dual-phenotype neurons play a sex-specific role in the crosstalk between the somatotropic and gonadotropic axes during pubertal transition.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Late maturing adolescents usually show delayed growth and bone age. At puberty, gonadal steroids have stimulatory effects on the activation of growth and reproductive axes, but the existence of gonadal steroid-sensitive neuronal crosstalk remains undefined. Moreover, the neural basis for the sex differences observed in the clinical arena is unknown. Lack of ER\u03b1 in GHRH neurons disrupts growth in both sexes and causes pubertal delay in females. Deletion of androgen receptor in GHRH neurons only delayed female puberty. In adult females, not males, a subset of GHRH neurons shift phenotype to start producing Kiss1. Thus, direct estrogen action in GHRH/Kiss1 dual-phenotype neurons modulates growth and puberty and may orchestrate the sex differences in endocrine function observed during pubertal transition."

        "abstract": "Over the last two decades the mechanisms that underpin cell survival and cell death have been intensively studied. One molecule in particular, Receptor Interacting Protein Kinase 1 (RIPK1), has gained interest due to the ability to function upstream of both NF-\u03baB signaling and caspase-dependent and -independent cell death. RIPK1 is critical in determining cell fate downstream of cytokine signaling receptors such as the Tumour Necrosis Factor Receptor Super Family (TNFRSF) and the innate immune Toll-like receptors. Various studies have attempted to untangle how ubiquitination of RIPK1 dictates signaling outcomes; however, due to the complex nature of ubiquitin signaling it has been difficult to prove that ubiquitination of RIPK1 does in fact influence signaling outcomes. Therefore, we ask the question: What do we really know about RIPK1 ubiquitination, and, to what extent can we conclude that ubiquitination of RIPK1 impacts RIPK1-mediated signaling events?"

        "abstract": "The plantaris muscle is located in the posterior aspect of the superficial compartment of the lower leg, running from the lateral condyle of the femur to the calcaneal tuberosity. Classically, it is characterized by a small and fusiform muscle belly, which then changes into a long slender tendon. From the evolutionary point of view, the muscle is considered vestigial. However, it has recently been suspected of being a highly specialized sensory muscle because of its high density of muscle spindles. It has a noticeable tendency to vary in respect of both origin and insertion. Researchers have published many reports on the potential clinical significance of the muscle belly and tendon, including mid-portion Achilles tendinopathy, 'tennis leg syndrome', and popliteal artery entrapment syndrome. The right knee joint area was subjected to classical anatomical dissection, during which an atypical plantaris muscle was found and examined in detail. Accurate morphometric measurements were made. The muscle belly was assessed as bifurcated. Morphologically, superior and inferior parts were presented. There was a tendinous connection (named band A) with the iliotibial tract and an additional insertion (named band B) to the semimembranosus tendon. Both bands A and B presented very broad fan-shaped attachments. The human plantaris muscle is of considerable interest and has frequent morphological variations in its proximal part. Its specific characteristics can cause clinical problems and lead to confusion in diagnosis. More studies are needed to define its actual features and functions."

In this study, we investigated whether minimally processed dairy streams with high levels of whey proteins as potential infant nutrition ingredients could also induce trained immunity, and to what extent this can be explained by the presence of bIgG. The minimally processed whey ingredients serum protein concentrate (SPC) and whey protein concentrate (WPC) were tested for their ability to induce trained immunity in human peripheral blood monocytes. Both ingredients induced trained immunity as evidenced by an increased production of TNF-\u03b1 and, to a lesser extent, of IL-6 upon stimulation with TLR ligands. This was comparable to isolated bovine immunoglobulin G (bIgG) that served as positive control. Depletion of bIgG from both whey protein-containing ingredients did not significantly inhibit the induction of trained immunity, suggesting that the streams contain other components in addition to bIgG that are able to induce trained immunity. These results indicate that minimally processed whey ingredients may contribute to protection against infections through enhancing innate immune responsiveness to pathogens."

However, the conventional synthesis of silica aerogels involves the use of expensive and toxic alkoxide precursors and surface modifiers such as trimethylchlorosilane. In this study, cost-effective water-glass silica aerogels were synthesized using an eco-friendly catechol derivative surface modifier instead of trimethylchlorosilane. Polydopamine was introduced to increase adhesion to the SiO<sub>2</sub> surface. The addition of 4-<i>tert</i>-butyl catechol and hexylamine imparted hydrophobicity to the surface and suppressed the polymerization of the polydopamine. After an ambient pressure drying process, catechol-modified aerogel exhibited a specific surface area of 377 m<sup>2</sup>/g and an average pore diameter of approximately 21 nm. To investigate their thermal conductivities, glass wool sheets were impregnated with catechol-modified aerogel. The thermal conductivity was 40.4 mWm<sup>-1</sup>K<sup>-1</sup>, which is lower than that of xerogel at 48.7 mWm<sup>-1</sup>K<sup>-1</sup>. Thus, by precisely controlling the catechol coating in the mesoporous framework, an eco-friendly synthetic method for aerogel preparation is proposed."

To date, studies on the gut microbiota have focused on the genus-level composition and microbial gene sets, whereas changes in the microbiota after clinical treatment have remained largely elusive. In the present study, 16 subjects with T2DM were enrolled and treated long-term with a low-fat diet. Stool samples were collected at the initial diagnosis and after 1, 3 and 6 months of treatment, and named as group T0, T1, T2 and T3, respectively. Simultaneously, stool samples from 16 healthy individuals were collected as a control (group C). In addition, 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing was performed to detect differences in the microbiota between the groups. Following the low-fat diet treatment, the patients' fasting plasma glucose, plasma glucose 2 h after challenge, glycosylated haemoglobin A1c and body mass index (BMI) decreased significantly. The composition of the phylum in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus was similar to that in healthy individuals. A total of 23 genera from four phyla, namely Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria, were determined to be different between group T0 and group C, while only 8 genera were different between group T3 and group C. Repeated analysis of variance suggested a complex change during the low-fat diet treatment. The butyrate-producing bacteria Anaerotruncus exhibited a slight increase, while Roseburia was significantly increased at the T1 stage but then gradually decreased at the later stage. In summary, a low-fat diet was effective for patients with T2DM in reducing blood glucose and the BMI, and, to a certain extent, improving the intestinal flora to reach a normal composition. The study was registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR; registration no. ChiCTR1900028663)."

Constipation has a serious impact on the activity of daily living and quality of life in dementia patients. The relationships between constipation, demographic variables, and the nutritional status of patients with dementia remain unknown. This study aimed to assess the possible factors associated with constipation. This cross-sectional study was conducted at the Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital from January to November 2019. This hospital is a medical center and the main referral hospital of southern Taiwan, serving 3 million inhabitants. In total, 119 patients with dementia were evaluated using the Rome III diagnostic criteria for functional constipation. There were 30 patients with dementia included in the constipation group and 89 patients with dementia included in the no constipation group. Mini-Nutritional Assessment and 3-day diet diary records were employed. The clinical dementia rating score was used to evaluate the severity of dementia in patients of the outpatient clinic. Approximately 25.2% of dementia patients had constipation. Patients in the dementia with constipation group were older, had severer dementia, and displayed a lower water intake. After multivariable adjustment, low liquid consumption was the predictor of constipation among patients with dementia. The findings support the clinical recommendations to treat constipation with an increased liquid intake, but not exercise, in dementia patients."

These videos were processed using the convolutional neural network Loopy for automated prediction of body parts. Development of the model was carried out in several steps, including annotation of the key points, training of the network to generate the model and checking the model for its accuracy. The key points nose, withers and tail are detected with a sensitivity of more than 80% and an error rate between 2 and 7%, depending on the key point. By means of a case study, the possibility of further analysis with the acquired data was investigated. The results will significantly improve the pain recognition of horses and will help to develop algorithms for the automated recognition of behaviour using machine learning."

        "abstract": "(1) Background: In the healthy ageing, NK cell number is not modified; however, their spontaneous cytotoxicity decreases. We postulated that the age-dependent decline in metabolic activities might be responsible for this effect. (2) Methods: The fatty acid profile of 30 healthy young males (23 \u00b1 4 years old, BMI 22.1 \u00b1 1.3) and 30 older males (63 \u00b1 5 years old, BMI 22.9 \u00b1 2.5) donors were evaluated along with the expression of killing (KR) and inhibitory NK receptors (KIR) at basal level and after cultivation with fatty acids for 24 h. (3) Results: Significantly higher levels of oleic (<i>p</i> < 0.01), arachidonic (<i>p</i> < 0.001), lignoceric (<i>p</i> < 0.001), and nervonic acids (<i>p</i> < 0.0001) and significantly lower levels of docosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids (<i>p</i> < 0.01) were found in elders as compared to young adults. At basal levels, significant (<i>p</i> < 0.005) differences in KR and KIR expression were encountered; 12/16 antigens. Treatment of cells with saturated fatty acids or arachidonic acid (AA) significantly enhanced KR expressions (<i>p</i> < 0.001). AA treatment decreased inhibitory KIR expression while docosahexaenoic, and eicosapentaenoic acid increased them. (4) Conclusions: Changes in fatty acids blood levels, and KR and KIR expression in NK cell, are age-dependent. Supplementation of NK cells with eicosapentaenoic or docosahexaenoic acid enhanced inhibitory KIR receptors' expression which may improve their cell function."

        "abstract": "Prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE) after surgical aortic valve replacement and transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) carries significant morbidity/mortality. Our review aims to compare incidence, predisposing factors, microbiology, diagnosis, management, and outcomes of PVE in surgical aortic valve replacement/TAVR patients. We searched PubMed and Embase to identify published studies from January 1, 2015 to March 13, 2020. Key words were indexed for original reports, clinical studies, and reviews. Reports were evaluated by 2 authors against a priori inclusion/exclusion criteria. Studies were included if they reported incidence and outcomes related to surgical aortic valve replacement/TAVR PVE and excluded if they were published pre-2015 or included a small population. We followed the Cochrane methodology and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines for all stages of the design and implementation. Study quality was based on the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Thirty-three studies with 311 to 41\u200a025 patients contained relevant information. The majority found no significant difference in incidence of surgical aortic valve replacement/TAVR PVE (reported as 0.3%-1.2% per patient-year versus 0.6%-3.4%), but there were key differences in pathogenesis. TAVR has a specific set of infection risks related to entry site, procedure, and device, including nonstandardized protocols for infection control, valve crimping injury, paravalvular leak, neo-leaflet stress, intact/calcified native leaflets, and intracardiac hardware. With the expansion of TAVR to lower risk and younger patients, a better understanding of pathogenesis, patient presentation, and guideline-directed treatment is paramount. When operative intervention is necessary, mortality remains high at 20% to 30%. Unique TAVR infection risks present opportunities for PVE prevention, therefore, further investigation is imperative."
