        "abstract": "<b>Purpose of review: </b>Machine learning approaches-which seek to predict outcomes or classify patient features by recognizing patterns in large datasets-are increasingly applied to clinical epidemiology research on diabetes. Given its novelty and emergence in fields outside of biomedical research, machine learning terminology, techniques, and research findings may be unfamiliar to diabetes researchers. Our aim was to present the use of machine learning approaches in an approachable way, drawing from clinical epidemiological research in diabetes published from 1 Jan 2017 to 1 June 2020.<br><br><b>Recent findings: </b>Machine learning approaches using tree-based learners-which produce decision trees to help guide clinical interventions-frequently have higher sensitivity and specificity than traditional regression models for risk prediction. Machine learning approaches using neural networking and \"deep learning\" can be applied to medical image data, particularly for the identification and staging of diabetic retinopathy and skin ulcers. Among the machine learning approaches reviewed, researchers identified new strategies to develop standard datasets for rigorous comparisons across older and newer approaches, methods to illustrate how a machine learner was treating underlying data, and approaches to improve the transparency of the machine learning process. Machine learning approaches have the potential to improve risk stratification and outcome prediction for clinical epidemiology applications. Achieving this potential would be facilitated by use of universal open-source datasets for fair comparisons. More work remains in the application of strategies to communicate how the machine learners are generating their predictions."

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND:Only a subset of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) develop adverse cardiac events - e.g., end-stage heart failure, cardiovascular death. Current risk stratification methods are imperfect, limiting identification of high-risk patients with HCM. Our aim was to improve the prediction of adverse cardiac events in patients with HCM using machine learning methods. METHODS:We applied modern machine learning methods to a prospective cohort of adults with HCM. The outcome was a composite of death due to heart failure, heart transplant, and sudden death. As the reference model, we constructed logistic regression model using known predictors. We determined 20 predictive characteristics based on random forest classification and a priori knowledge, and developed 4 machine learning models. Results Of 183 patients in the cohort, the mean age was 53 (SD\u00a0=\u00a017) years and 45% were female. During the median follow-up of 2.2\u00a0years (interquartile range, 0.6-3.8), 33 subjects (18%) developed an outcome event, the majority of which (85%) was heart transplant. The predictive accuracy of the reference model was 73% (sensitivity 76%, specificity 72%) while that of the machine learning model was 85% (e.g., sensitivity 88%, specificity 84% with elastic net regression). All 4 machine learning models significantly outperformed the reference model - e.g., area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve 0.79 with the reference model vs. 0.93 with elastic net regression (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). CONCLUSIONS:Compared with conventional risk stratification, the machine learning models demonstrated a superior ability to predict adverse cardiac events. These modern machine learning methods may enhance identification of high-risk HCM subpopulations."

Various studies have aimed at developing machine learning models to diagnose malaria using blood smear images; however, this approach has many limitations. This study developed a machine learning model for malaria diagnosis using patient information.<br><br><b>Methods: </b>To construct datasets, we extracted patient information from the PubMed abstracts from 1956 to 2019. We used two datasets: a solely parasitic disease dataset and total dataset by adding information about other diseases.

However, these tools have also been shown to exacerbate inequities faced by marginalized groups. Focusing on health disparities should be part of good machine learning practice and regulatory oversight of software as medical devices. Using the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)'s proposed framework for regulating machine learning tools in medicine, I show that addressing health disparities during the premarket and postmarket stages of review can help anticipate and mitigate group harms."

        "abstract": "Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), according to DSM-5 in the American Psychiatric Association, is a neurodevelopmental disorder that includes deficits of social communication and social interaction with the presence of restricted and repetitive behaviors. Children with ASD have difficulties in joint attention and social reciprocity, using non-verbal and verbal behavior for communication. Due to these deficits, children with autism are often socially isolated. Researchers have emphasized the importance of early identification and early intervention to improve the level of functioning in language, communication, and well-being of children with autism. However, due to limited local assessment tools to diagnose these children, limited speech-language therapy services in rural areas, etc., these children do not get the rehabilitation they need until they get into compulsory schooling at the age of seven years old. Hence, efficient approaches towards early identification and intervention through speedy diagnostic procedures for ASD are required. In recent years, advanced technologies like machine learning have been used to analyze and investigate ASD to improve diagnostic accuracy, time, and quality without complexity. These machine learning methods include artificial neural networks, support vector machines, a priori algorithms, and decision trees, most of which have been applied to datasets connected with autism to construct predictive models. Meanwhile, the selection of features remains an essential task before developing a predictive model for ASD classification. This review mainly investigates and analyzes up-to-date studies on machine learning methods for feature selection and classification of ASD. We recommend methods to enhance machine learning's speedy execution for processing complex data for conceptualization and implementation in ASD diagnostic research. This study can significantly benefit future research in autism using a machine learning approach for feature selection, classification, and processing imbalanced data."

        "abstract": "We developed a machine learning model for efficient analysis of echocardiographic image quality in hospitalized patients.\u00a0This study applied a machine learning model for automated transthoracic echo (TTE) image quality scoring in three inpatient groups. Our objectives were: (1) Assess the feasibility of a machine learning model for echo image quality analysis, (2) Establish the comprehensiveness of real-world TTE reporting by clinical group, and (3) Determine the relationship between machine learning image quality and comprehensiveness of TTE reporting. A machine learning model was developed and applied to TTEs from three matched cohorts for image quality of nine standard views. Case TTEs were comprehensive studies in mechanically ventilated patients between 01/01/2010 and 12/31/2015. For each case TTE, there were two matched spontaneously breathing controls (Control 1: Inpatients scanned in the lab and Control 2: Portable studies). We report the overall mean maximum and view specific quality scores for each TTE. The comprehensiveness of an echo report was calculated as the documented proportion of 12 standard parameters. An inverse probability weighted regression model was fit to determine the relationship between machine learning quality score and the completeness of a TTE report. 175 mechanically ventilated TTEs were included with 350 non-intubated samples (175 Control 1: Lab and 175 Control 2: Portable). In total, the machine learning model analyzed 14,086 echo video clips for quality. The overall accuracy of the model with regard to the expert ground truth for the view classification was 87.0%. The overall mean maximum quality score was lower for mechanically ventilated TTEs (0.55 [95% CI 0.54, 0.56]) versus 0.61 (95% CI 0.59, 0.62) for Control 1: Lab and 0.64 (95% CI 0.63, 0.66) for Control 2: Portable; p\u2009=\u20090.002. Furthermore, mechanically ventilated TTE reports were the least comprehensive, with fewer reported parameters. The regression model demonstrated the correlation of echo image quality and completeness of TTE reporting regardless of the clinical group. Mechanically ventilated TTEs were of inferior quality and clinical utility compared to spontaneously breathing controls and machine learning derived image quality correlates with completeness of TTE reporting regardless of the clinical group."
