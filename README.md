# **DolfinGo**
## **General Description**
Dolfin Go is a web system designed for retrieving scientific articles and automatically generating their abstracts from the title.
The platform uses a GPT-2 model that has been fine-tuned with a dataset of 6,102 scientific articles in the field of computer science.

The main goal of Dolfin Go is to assist researchers by allowing them to quickly obtain a coherent and contextualized abstract of an article using only its title, thereby optimizing the literature review process.

## **Main Features**
* **Smart Search:** Retrieves scientific articles from the Europe PMC database , a repository containing millions of biomedical research articles.
* **Relevance Ranking:** Ranks search results using a weighted combination of *Jaccard* and *Vector Cosine* with *TF-IDF* similarity metrics.
* **AI-Powered Abstract Generation:** Uses a fine-tuned GPT-2 model to generate an automatic and coherent abstract in real-time based on the selected article's title.
* **Comparative Analysis:** Provides a quantitative comparison between the author's original abstract and the one generated by the AI, displaying Jaccard and Cosine similarity scores to evaluate their divergence.
* **Intuitive Web Interface:** Developed with a front-end and back-end architecture for a smooth and efficient user experience.

## **Architecture and Technology**
The system is composed of a front-end and a back-end that hosts the business logic and the Machine Learning model.
### **Back-end:**

* Developed in Python 3.8.10 with the Flask 1.1.4 microframework.
* Exposes a *RESTful API* to manage searches and text generation.
* Connects to the Europe PMC API for document retrieval.

### **Front-end:**

* Built with Node.js and Bootstrap.

### **Artificial Intelligence Model:**

* Uses the GPT-2 model from OpenAI.
* The model was re-trained (fine-tuned) with 6,102 abstracts from computer science articles to specialize it in generating coherent scientific text.
