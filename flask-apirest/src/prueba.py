w= 'large and increasing number of different types of interatomic potentials exist, either based on parametrised analytical functions or machine learning The choice of potential to be used in a molecular dynamics simulation should be based on the affordable computational cost and required accuracy We develop and compare four interatomic potentials of different complexity for iron a simple machine learned embedded atom method EAM potential, a potential with machinelearned two and threebodydependent terms, a potential with machinelearned EAM and threebody terms, and a Gaussian approximation potential with the smooth overlap of atomic positions descriptor All potentials are trained to the same diverse database of bodycentred cubic and liquid structures computed with density functional theory The first three potentials are tabulated and evaluated efficiently using cubic spline interpolations, while the fourth one is implemented without additional optimisation The four potentials span three orders of magnitude in computational cost We compare and discuss the advantages of each potential in terms of transferability and the balance between accuracy and computational cost'
